### IMPORTANT:  
### This application is not a virus and will not gain access or harm your computer, Reddit account, or anything else. Snookey2 is completely open source so you can check the .py file for all the code and see that there's nothing harmful. None of this data is stored, because I don't even know how to do that. I wouldn't even do it anyways if I knew how cause that would be really evil and ruin my reputation forever... Anyways, thank you for understanding, and have fun streaming!

The text and stuff below was originally made by u/Spikeedoo (with some modifications from me):

# Snookey2
Some reddit users figured out a way to stream to RPAN (Reddit's livestreaming platform) from desktop streaming software 
(like OBS).  Project SnooKey is my attempt at making this possibilty more accessible to RPAN users.

## Installation  
There's 2 ways to install Snookey2:  
Method 1 (Recommended) - Do pip install snookey2  
Method 2 (Not really recommended unless you want the code for it) - Go to the Github page and download the .py file there!

## Using Snookey2  
This covers Method 1 of the Installation.  
Method 2 will not be covered here for simplicity.

After doing the pip install command for Snookey2, go into command prompt and type this command:  
snookey stream subreddit title  
But replace subreddit with the subreddit and title with the stream title.

If done correctly, this will open a link in your browser allowing you to get an access code from Reddit     
**NOTE:** The Reddit app you are allowing access is not mine.  It is the client_id for the mobile, in this case android, Reddit app.    
One way you can confirm that I am not BS'ing you is by looking at [your apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) after allowing access.  
A third party application would normally appear here in the 'authorized applications' section with the developer's username.  This Reddit-built  
application does not follow the same rules.   

Just follow what the script says by reading the text, and follow the video tutorial or join the Discord server!

## Using Snookey2 in a Python Script  
So if you really want to, you can use Snookey2 in a Python script for whatever you're making!

First you have to do import snookey2 and you're set to do any of these commands!  
(The prefix for all of these commands is snookey2 so for example snookey2.commandhere)  

List of currently available functions:  
drp() - Enables Discord Rich Presence, so dont include it if you dont want it.  
info() - Info about Snookey2  
sublist() - Gives a list of all the supported subreddits  
tutorial() - Opens up the video tutorial  
discord() - Opens up the invite link to the Discord  
init(subreddit, title) - Actually run Snookey2  

and with that, Snookey2 is now a Python module to celebrate v3.0!

(Make sure to join the Discord for any questions!)
